# Data-Portfolio
A set of personal projects that I have completed/working on to gain familarity with the tools used in the data world. To start, the machine learning folder contains an analysis of a Trip Advisor Hotel Reviews dataset that I got from Kaggle which I took and developed a couple different supervised and unsupervised models on. The resulting notebook and physical dataset is displayed as well.
